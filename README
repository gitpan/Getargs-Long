Getargs::Long - Named subroutine arguments, with optional type checking

The "Getargs::Long" module allows usage of named parameters in function calls,
along with optional argument type-checking.  It provides an easy way to get at
the parameters within the routine, and yields concise descriptions for the
common cases of all-mandatory and all-optional parameter lists.

MODULE DEPENDENCIES
 
To use this module, you will need to install:

- Log::Agent
- version::Limit

You should be prompted to install this module automatically when you run "perl
Makefile.PL".


INSTALLATION

To install this package, change to the directory where you unarchived this
distribution and type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

You can install this package into a non-default location by appending one of
the following to the "perl Makefile.PL" command:

- "PREFIX=/installation/path" (for installation into a custom location),
- "INSTALLDIRS=site" (for installation into site-specific Perl directories)
- "INSTALLDIRS=perl" (for installation into standard Perl directories).

If you make the installation into your own directory, then remember that you
must tell perl where to search for modules before trying to 'use' them. For
example:

  use lib '/home/userid/lib';
  use Getargs::Long;

If "make test" fails, run

  make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

and see which test(s) are failing. Please email the results to the address
